# PacMan-01
# Description
This project is for Week 04 of MIT xPro Full Stack with MERN Certificate.
In this project, I learned to use JavaScript logic to be able to change the image displayed if certain conditions are met. 
For example, PacMan's image must change from open mouth to closed mouth after every step he takes. Moreover, the images displayed also change based on whether he is going to the right or to the left. 
# Instructions
Press any key to get PacMan to start moving. Press any key again to get him to stop moving.
